Current State

Your NCTS syndication app has a solid foundation:

- ✅ OAuth2 authentication with NCTS
- ✅ Atom feed parsing and filtering
- ✅ Download and storage of terminology files (SNOMED SNAPSHOT, AMT CSV, ValueSets)
- ✅ SQLite storage with version tracking
- ✅ Import functionality with ZIP extraction
- ✅ Query operations (search, lookup, ValueSet expansion)
- ✅ Basic Tauri frontend UI

Recommended Next Steps

Phase 1: Polish Current Features (High Priority)

1. UI/UX Improvements


    - Add import progress indicators (currently imports can take 5-10 minutes with no feedback)
    - Show import status on terminology cards (downloaded vs imported)
    - Add search interface to test the query functionality
    - Display storage statistics (database size, record counts)

2. Error Handling & User Feedback


    - Better error messages in the UI
    - Retry logic for failed downloads
    - Connection testing before syncing

3. Testing & Validation


    - Test full sync → import → query workflow
    - Verify SNOMED hierarchy queries work correctly
    - Test with actual NCTS credentials
    - Benchmark query performance

Phase 2: Desktop App Enhancement (Medium Priority)

4. Advanced Query Features


    - SNOMED hierarchy navigation (parent/child concepts)
    - Relationship traversal (find all descendants/ancestors)
    - Advanced search with filters (active only, by terminology type)
    - Export search results

5. Maintenance Features


    - Database vacuum/optimization command
    - Clear old versions (keep last N versions)
    - Verify data integrity
    - Re-import corrupted data

Phase 3: OPDQ Integration Prep (Future Vision)

6. Prepare for Questionnaire Integration


    - Create Tauri commands for ValueSet-driven questions
    - Build questionnaire builder UI mockup
    - Plan SolidJS component architecture
    - Research BC-UR QR libraries for Rust/JS

7. Security Foundation


    - Add SQLCipher support (encrypted database)
    - Test OS keychain integration
    - Implement session management patterns
