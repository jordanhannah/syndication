Current State

Your NCTS syndication app has a solid foundation:

- ✅ OAuth2 authentication with NCTS
- ✅ Atom feed parsing and filtering
- ✅ Download and storage of terminology files (SNOMED SNAPSHOT, AMT CSV, ValueSets)
- ✅ SQLite storage with version tracking
- ✅ Import functionality with ZIP extraction
- ✅ Query operations (search, lookup, ValueSet expansion)
- ✅ Basic Tauri frontend UI
- ✅ **NEW: Real-time import progress indicators with streaming events**
- ✅ **NEW: Connection testing with detailed status reporting**
- ✅ **NEW: Database size tracking in statistics panel**
- ✅ **NEW: Enhanced error messages with actionable hints**

Phase 1 Completed Features ✅

1. UI/UX Improvements - **COMPLETED**

    - ✅ Real-time import progress indicators with percentage, phase tracking, and live updates
    - ✅ Show import status on terminology cards (downloaded vs imported)
    - ✅ Search interface with full-text search across all terminologies
    - ✅ Storage statistics panel (database size, record counts)
    - ✅ Visual progress bars during import operations
    - ✅ ValueSet browser with expansion capabilities

2. Error Handling & User Feedback - **COMPLETED**

    - ✅ Better error messages in the UI with detailed breakdowns
    - ✅ Connection testing button with authentication and feed access verification
    - ✅ Actionable error hints (e.g., "Check your .env file")
    - ✅ Color-coded status indicators (success/error/in-progress)

3. Testing & Validation - **IN PROGRESS**

    - ⏳ Test full sync → import → query workflow with real NCTS credentials
    - ⏳ Verify SNOMED hierarchy queries work correctly
    - ⏳ Benchmark query performance

Immediate Next Steps

**Ready for Production Testing:**
- Test with your NCTS credentials (.env file configured)
- Run: `cargo tauri dev`
- Test the "Test NCTS Connection" button
- Try syncing a small terminology (ValueSets recommended first)
- Test import progress indicator during import
- Verify search functionality works
- Check storage statistics update

Phase 2: Desktop App Enhancement (Medium Priority)

4. Advanced Query Features - **FUTURE**

    - SNOMED hierarchy navigation (parent/child concepts)
    - Relationship traversal (find all descendants/ancestors)
    - Advanced search with filters (active only, by terminology type)
    - Export search results

5. Maintenance Features - **FUTURE**

    - Database vacuum/optimization command
    - Clear old versions (keep last N versions)
    - Verify data integrity
    - Re-import corrupted data
    - Error recovery for interrupted imports (resume from last batch)

Phase 3: OPDQ Integration Prep (Future Vision)

6. Prepare for Questionnaire Integration


    - Create Tauri commands for ValueSet-driven questions
    - Build questionnaire builder UI mockup
    - Plan SolidJS component architecture
    - Research BC-UR QR libraries for Rust/JS

7. Security Foundation


    - Add SQLCipher support (encrypted database)
    - Test OS keychain integration
    - Implement session management patterns
